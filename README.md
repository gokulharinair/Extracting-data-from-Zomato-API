# Extracting-data-from-Zomato-API
This repository contains the source code used to extract data from the Zomato API, as well as the outcomes in the form of pie charts, bar graphs,etc.

Data has been directly extracted and analysed from Zomato API in the first notebook, while data extraction and analysis has been carried out on the CSV file provided by Coding Ninjas, containing additional data which could not be accessed using the API's basic plan.
